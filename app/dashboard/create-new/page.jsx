const scriptData = 'Antica, the port city of Rome, pulsates with the lifeblood of the Empire. A melting pot of cultures and commerce, where fortunes are made and lost with every sunrise.Marcus Aurelius Flavius, a merchant with years of experience, assesses his latest delivery. Olive oil, the liquid gold of the Mediterranean, is his specialty. But lately, trade has becomeâ€¦ complicated.Whispers of rising costs and shortages plague the market. Marcus seeks answers from a contact, a figure shrouded in mystery. He learns of disruption, of pirates operating unchecked, of a hidden plot.The seas, once dependable, have become treacherous. Pirate ships, like wraiths in the night, prey on Roman merchant vessels. It is said they are supported by those within Rome itself, who seek chaos for their own gain.Marcus, a man of the people, refuses to stand idly by. He begins to piece together fragments of information, charting the locations of pirate attacks and trade routes. A dangerous plan begins to take shape.He takes his evidence to the local legion. With their support, he leads a counter strike against the pirates. It is not an easy battle, but Roman discipline and courage prevail, routing the pirates.The disruption is quelled, trade flows freely once more, and the threat, for now, is eliminated. Marcus had saved the city and the Empire by confronting his adversity. And his courage is remembered for generations to come.'
